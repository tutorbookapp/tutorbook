          All of our proceeds go directly to the Save the Music Foundation, a
          national organization that partners with local communities and school
          districts to provide instruments, invest in music technology, help
          teachers with curriculum and professional development, and generally
          support music education in public schools. With your help, we can give
          thousands of kids across the country exposure to music in the same way
          that many of our teachers were first able to.

          Thank you so much and we will keep in touch with you regarding future

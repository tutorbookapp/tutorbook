# Data Models

This directory contains all of the data models used throughout the app and
back-end (i.e. in our serverless functions).

That's one of the distinct advantages of using Next.js and Typescript for both
front-end and back-end; we can define one set of data models and use them
everywhere.

**Note:** This `README` does not contain up-to-date definitions for all the
classes, types, enums, and interfaces within this directory. If you're looking
for those, just look at the code. The purpose of this `README` is to provide a
high-level overview of the data flow within our app and to foster good [README
driven development](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html).
